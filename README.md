# Lithium

Lithium is a small Magisk module focused on **battery life and performance** 

This is my **first time touching the Android ROM / modding community**, so this project is intentionally simple and im not that good

I’m still in school, so development is **slow and inconsistent**, but I’ll update it when I have time and when things are stable.


## What Lithium is
- A lightweight Magisk module
- Focused on:
  - Lower idle drain
  - Slightly better smoothness
  - No aggressive or risky tweaks
- Designed to stay close to upstream behavior



## What Lithium is NOT
- Not a full custom ROM
- Not a kernel
- Not a “gaming booster”
- Not a magic performance mod

If you’re expecting huge FPS gains or miracles, this isn’t it.



 Compatibility
- LineageOS and LineageOS-based ROMs  
  (tested on LineageOS / crDroid)
- Android 13+  
- Root required (Magisk)

Other ROMs *might* work, but no guarantees
