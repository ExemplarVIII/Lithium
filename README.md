# Lithium

Lithium is a small Magisk module focused on **battery life and performance** 

This is my **first time touching the Android ROM / modding community**, so this project is intentionally simple and im not that good

I’m still in school, so development is **slow and inconsistent**, but I’ll update it when I have time and when things are stable.


## What Lithium is
- A lightweight Magisk module
- Focused on:
  - Lower idle drain
  - Slightly better smoothness
  - No aggressive or risky tweaks
- Designed to stay close to upstream behavior



## What Lithium is NOT
- Not a full custom ROM
- Not a kernel
- Not a “gaming booster”
- Not a magic performance mod

If you’re expecting huge FPS gains or miracles, this isn’t it.



 Compatibility
- LineageOS and LineageOS-based ROMs  
  (tested on LineageOS / crDroid)
- Android 13+  
- Root required (Magisk)

Other ROMs *might* work, but no guarantees


## Versions

### Lithium v1
- Initial release
- Small system-level tweaks
- Focus on stability and battery efficiency

### Lithium v1.1
- Performance-lean tuning
- Smoother multitasking behavior
- Minor UI rendering improvements
- Still focused on stability and battery efficiency

### Lithium v1.2 
A balanced update focused on stability, smoothness, and efficiency.
Changes:

- Refined performance stability under sustained usage
- Improved balance between responsiveness and battery life
- Additional non-aggressive system optimizations
- Further refinement of tweaks introduced in v1.1

### Lithium v1.3
balanced update with runtime optimizations.

- Runtime scheduler tuning
- Storage I/O optimization
- Improved background app handling
- Adaptive battery enforcement
- Reduced runtime logging
- Improved UI consistency

## Upcoming

### Lithium v1.4 – Balanced (planned)
Focuses on refinement and polish while keeping stability.

Planned changes:
- Further runtime optimization refinements
- Improved background task consistency
- Minor efficiency improvements
- Additional stability tuning

### Lithium v1.5 – Refinement Update (planned)
A small update focused on consistency and cleanup.

Planned changes:
- Minor performance refinements
- Further efficiency tuning

Plans may change depending on testing results and available time.

## Installation
1. Install Magisk
2. Flash the Lithium zip
3. Reboot

That’s it.
